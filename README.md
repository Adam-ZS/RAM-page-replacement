# RAM Page Replacement Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of three RAM page replacement algorithms: FIFO, LRU, and Optimal. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and can be used to simulate the behavior of a page replacement system in a virtual memory environment.

## Algorithms

### FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
The FIFO page replacement algorithm replaces the oldest page in memory when a new page is required.

### LRU (Least Recently Used)
The LRU algorithm replaces the least recently accessed page in memory when a new page is required.

### Optimal
The Optimal page replacement algorithm replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future.

## Example Usage
To run the example usage, execute the `example_run.py` script.
